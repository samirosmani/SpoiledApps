# SpoiledApps
An Android APK of an application developed by myself and three other phenomenal and brillant students in one of my Spring 2020 courses!

What is SpoiledApps?

SpoiledApps is an Android application that essentially allows users to sign up for an account where they can read and write reputable and genuine reviews of other applications on the Google Play Store. One of the biggest issues affecting both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store is that you have reviews for applications that can be written by simply anyone. These reviews sometimes have no relevance to the application being reviewed which are just simply random. While other reviews can complain about many features of an appliation but still give a five star rating nonetheless. Some reviews can actually be purchased by companies in order to bolster their application's overall app rating which entices users to download their app for usage. In SpoiledApps, we make sure all users that register with us first verify themselves by email verification. An email provided by the user during registration will be sent to that user which contains a link that simply needs to be clicked to be verified. The application will not allow you to use it if you are still not verified. Once a user is verfied, a user can use the application and start reviewing apps, reading other users reviews of other apps, or add an app themselves if they cannot find the app they desire. 

Technologies Utilized?
SpoiledApps was written using Java and we as a group also used Google Firebase as a backend for our database functions and authenication functions too.
